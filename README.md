# IAT-Api-Hash
A simple C project which I developed:

* Look up the IAT and load it entirley to a linked list
* Hash each API within the IAT using a CRC32 Hash
* Locate all hashed APIs within the list by brute forcing the IAT
* Locate and call hashed CRC32 API identifiers
* Create generic WINAPI calls using macros
